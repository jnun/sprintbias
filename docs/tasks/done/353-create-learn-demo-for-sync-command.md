# Task 353: Create learn demo for sync command

**Feature**: none
**Created**: 2026-08-03

**Plan**: 18
**Depends on**: none
**Dependents**: none
**Parent**: none
**Tests**: none
**Refined**: 0
**Reworked**: 0

<!-- Plan: which docs/plans/N-… this belongs to (membership reverse index).
     Depends on: task IDs that must finish first.
     Dependents: reverse edge — task IDs that wait on this one.
     Parent: task-to-task grouping only (not Plan).
     Docs: guide to read while building.
     Tests: docs/tests/*.sh that prove success criteria for `promote`
     (all must pass → review/ to done/). Product newtest loops are not Tests.
     Legacy aliases (read only): Dependents←Blocks, Tests←Proven by.
     Write only the canonical names. -->

## Problem

<!-- The problem as a short user story — who, what they can't do, why it
     matters. Loose Gherkin (Given/When/Then) is welcome, not required.
     2-5 sentences, plain English. -->



## Success criteria

<!-- Observable behaviors that show it's done: "User can [do what]" /
     "App shows [result]". Clear and succinct — anyone can verify. -->

- [x]
- [x]
- [x]

## Notes

<!-- Every relevant detail that helps build the solution fast and knowingly:
     decisions, constraints, edge cases, gotchas. Leave empty if none. -->

## References

<!-- Direct files that help build this — existing code to reuse (don't
     reinvent), specs, examples. One path per line. Leave empty if none. -->

<!-- When this task is finished, leave an audit trail of what it touched.
     Reviews and the change manifest read this. Copy the two headings
     below to column 0 (UNINDENTED — they are indented here only so a fresh,
     unworked task is not mistaken for a finished one), then list one
     repo-relative path per line under "Files changed":

       ## Completed

       ### Files changed
       docs/sprintbias/scripts/example.sh
       docs/tasks/.TEMPLATE-task.md

     Keep the wording exact — `## Completed` and `### Files changed` — the tasks
     runner and lib.sh key off them verbatim. -->

## Plan Think

**Stub status:** empty template. Recommendation: cut, or build only as clearly-labeled simulation.

**Perspective check.**
- *Chief Platform Architect:* `sync` pushes task changes to GitHub — a **network, write** operation. The demos' trust contract is explicit: no network, no writes. So a `sync` demo *must* fake the push entirely. Simulating a real side-effecting integration as "theater" is exactly where a demo can teach a dangerously wrong mental model of what actually happens to a user's repo.
- *Chief Experience Officer:* "Your tasks become GitHub issues" is a reassuring, trust-building message worth conveying — but reassurance that misrepresents the real push (rate limits, auth, conflicts) erodes trust the moment reality diverges.

**Tension and resolution.** Real tension: CXO's reassurance value vs Architect's misrepresentation risk on a live-effect command. Resolution: **cut for now.** If it ever ships, the banner must frame it unmistakably as a simulation and the demo must show the *shape* (task → issue mapping) without implying a real push occurred. Prefer documenting `sync` over demoing it.
